# Super Mario

## My attempt at making super mario. Didn't finish, but was able to lot quite a lot about Phaser along the way

## Findings
- Phaser has a physics library embedded in it. Super cool. Get to do collisions without having to code it myself, so I can focus more on the game/gameplay
- Physics library includes
    - Movement e.g. velocity, acceleration
    - Gravity (nuts!!!)
    - Bounce like if you drop on an object on the floor, it will bounce. You can replicate that same movement

## Learnings
- Learned how to create collisions
- Learned how to change movement of an object
- Learned how to create rectangle shapes and how to position them
- Learned how to make camera follow an object
- Learned how to put camera at an offset and change the snappiness of camera e.g. it will follow the object at a certain distance
- Learned about tween and how to add animations to objects
- Learned how to add gravity
- Learned how to make objects bounce, immovable, resistant to gravity

#### Going on from this project, I will try to create more simple games, so I can get a better understanding of Phaser and put everything together including animations
